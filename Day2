#Data Types
#In Python, there are four types of data types:
#Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans.

#Strings
#Strings are a type of data that represents text.
#Strings are written with quotation marks around them.
#You can use single or double quotation marks.
#Example:
print("Hello World")
print('Hello World')

#Integers
#Integers are a type of data that represents whole numbers.
#Integers are written without quotation marks.
#Example:
print(10)

#For more readable numbers, you can use underscores to separate the thousands.
#Example:
print(10_000)

#Floats
#Floats are a type of data that represents decimal numbers.
#Floats are written without quotation marks.
#Example:
print(3.14)

#Booleans
#Booleans are a type of data that represents True or False values.
#Booleans are written without quotation marks.
#Example:
print(True)
print(False)

#You can't mix integers with strings. For that, you have to convert the integer to a string.
#Example:
print("Hello " + str(10))

#There six operations in Python: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power, and Modulus.
#Addition:
print(10 + 10)

#Subtraction:  
print(20 - 10)

#Multiplication:
print(10 * 10)

#Division:
print(20 / 10)
#Notice how division will be a float type instead of a integer type

#Power:
print(2 ** 3)

#Modulus:
print(20 % 10)

#You can use parentheses to change the order of operations.
#Example:
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
